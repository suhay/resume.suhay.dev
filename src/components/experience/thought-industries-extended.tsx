        <li>
          <strong>Node.js developer for</strong> an e-learning platform. We built plugins and
          extensions for our platform users and clients to create robust and immersive courses,
          including video, slide shows, note-taking, and quizzes/tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Created and designed</strong> an abstraction layer that allowed customers the
          freedom to build out complex courses and certificate programs. I combined the smaller
          plugins into a cohesive and single place of use, making seamless transitioning between
          different parts of the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initiated a move</strong> to a brand new CI pipeline, including end-to-end user
          testing. Adding Enzyme to our already established Mocha unit tests, we significantly
          shortened our time to deployment for new features and bug fixes.
