      <p><strong>Team centric.</strong> One size does not fit all for someone's success, instead, always meet people where they are and start from there.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome over output.</strong> Forcing a victory at the cost of burnout is not worth celebrating.</p>
      <p><strong>Focus on finding a better way.</strong> Because we always did something one way doesn't mean it was the right one. Work the problem instead of only fixing the symptoms.</p>
